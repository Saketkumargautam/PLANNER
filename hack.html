    <h2> 5 Tips and Tricks To Crack The Hackathon </h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            STEP - 1 Go Team!
            <P>A good team always has a mixed group of a frontend developer, a backend developer, a
                graphic designer, a business developer, etc. Get to know your friend’s strengths and weaknesses and
                choose a diverse team accordingly. More importantly, it’s important to go with people that you get along
                with (and can have fun with). Some people can’t count the number of times they have encountered a team
                consisting of people who are all insanely skilled but haven’t done well in hackathons purely because of
                a few unresolved scuffles and ego clashes during the hack. Choosing a leader is the next most important
                thing. Bottlenecks are inevitable during a hackathon, and a leader is someone who’s decisive and has
                enough experience to guide the team towards progress when obstructions are encountered.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            STEP - 2 Look Elsewhere
            <P>While some hackathons have their problem statements released weeks in advance,
                some only release it during the hack. If your next hackathon is like the former, take time to sit with
                your team and look up the previous winners of the hackathon, projects that have won other hackathons,
                etc. Discussing existing ideas and how to improve them can prove to be a great mental exercise for you
                and your team, and help you come up with good ideas of your own. Even if your team has already decided
                upon an idea, I would recommend going through with this exercise because you never know where you’re
                going to find a feature that you could add to your project or a component that serves a similar purpose
                to one in your project but is much cheaper. Below are some projects/products that I found interesting,
                and can get the wheels in your brains rolling:</P>

            STEP - 3 Communication is Key
            <P>An image that always popped up in my head when I thought of a hackathon
                participant is one of a college student with headphones on, smacking away at his keyboard continually
                for 24 hours, completely content in his own little world of linked lists and stacks. After attending a
                hackathon, I learned that this is not quite the reality. It’s very important to talk to those around
                you. Talk to potential end-users of the product and understand their pain points. Talk to the judges and
                mentors, and understand what they’re looking for. Talk to other teams and learn about the problems
                they’re facing, cool APIs they’re using, etc. Include the insights that you’ve gained from talking to
                all these people, in your product. Most importantly, talk to your team. Before the hackathon, define a
                place for communication, like Slack and exchanging files, like Google Drive. During the hackathon, have
                short meetings every 3 hours or so, and share your progress.</P>

            STEP - 4 Tick Tock
            <P>Once your team has an idea that has been thoroughly discussed and chalked out on
                paper, take at least 10 minutes to evaluate the time it’ll take to execute your idea. While it may be
                tempting to add complicated but impressive features, spice up the interface, etc., it may unfortunately
                not be practical to implement these in just 24 hours. Pick only the features that can be built during
                the hackathon. If possible, hold a mock hackathon with your team before the real one, just to get a
                grasp over the possible problems that you might encounter and the time that it takes to solve these
                issues. This is also when you can set up a boilerplate project (boilerplate refers to sections of code
                that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration) to save time during the actual
                hack.</P>

        <LI>
            Present to Impress
            <P>Your presentation can either make or break your hackathon experience. A good
                presentation explains what problem your product is solving, how it’s different from the competitors, and
                market statistics related to your product. Put yourself in the judges’ shoes and question yourself about
                what you would want to see in a pitch. I’m sure the answer would be – a clean, concise and entertaining
                presentation. Don’t talk too much about technical theory unless you’re asked to. You can make your pitch
                interactive by involving the judges and/or the audience. Remember-Practice makes perfect, so have a
                trial run before you make your way to the judges.</P>
